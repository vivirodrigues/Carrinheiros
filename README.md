# Carrinheiros

### Abstract  

"Carrinheiros" are collectors of recyclable materials that use human propulsion vehicles in the selective collection. The problem is that route can be very tiring for waste pickers according to the increase in vehicle weight and the roads' slope. Therefore, this work proposes a route suggestion service to minimize the collection time or the pickers' physical effort on the route. The characteristics of the scenario addressed in this proposal are the distance between collect points, the depot's geographical position, the inclination of the roads, and the use of vehicles with human propulsion. Besides, this work should consider the variation in vehicle weight along the route. The proposal's validation was performed through computer simulations, using SUMO. This work used the tools osmnxand networkx to construct graphs, geographic data from Open Street Map, and elevation data from Topodata.
